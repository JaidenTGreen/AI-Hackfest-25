# AI-Hackfest-25
### My project for AI Hackfest 2025; a digital hackathon centered around Artificial Intelligence.

The idea behind my project is to have a website that users could upload their resume and preferred field in computer science
AI would respond with a few interview questions, and would give feedback on the responses.
I have a very limited grasp on AI (A few failed projects) so I would like to see what I can learn and implement this weekend!

# DevLog
## Friday April 11th
### 2:30pm:
Started the project at 10AM, spent a few hours getting comfortable and finding a path I wanted to fallow to develop my project.
I was going to use Gemini API, but I ran into too many bugs to continue.
I decided to pay for an OpenAI key to use ChatGPT4.
Recently, I got my python code to run ChatGPT4 through the API and included dotenv and venv to protect my API key.
